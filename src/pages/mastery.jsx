          Goal is to to master the 5 pillars of life. No one in documented
          history has done it.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p className="prose-xl">
        <strong>Pillar #1: No Self-Conflict </strong>:
        <div>
          Self-conflict is just another word for suffering. Everyone has
          problems, thus everyone suffers. Mastering this pillar means that
          self-conflict does not exist within you. You have no major flawed
          assumptions about yourself or about life.
        </div>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p className="prose-xl">
        <strong>
          Pillar #2: Solving a Problem that Impacts The Whole World{" "}
        </strong>
        :
        <div>
          I think of Tesla, I think of SpaceX, I think of the printing press, I
          think of the iPhone, I think of Amazon Marketplace, I think of the
          Ford Model-T, I think of chatGPT. Something that genuinely helps the
          world in a big way.
        </div>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p className="prose-xl">
        <strong>Pillar #3: Physical Fitness & Health </strong>:
        <div>
          Being in supremely good physical shape. The body of a warrior. I think
          of Leonidas I from the movie 300. Or a modern example could be
          Killmonger from Black Panther and I think of David Goggins as the real
          life example.
        </div>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p className="prose-xl">
        <strong>Pillar #4: Charisma & Confidence </strong>:
        <div>
          Very unique in their personality from everyone else. Able to capture
          your attention, there is an aura to them. I think of Jamie Foxx's
          energy, I think of Stephen A Smith's sass, I think of Shah Rukh Khan
          in his movies, I think of Keegan Michael Key in his skits, I think of
          Maajid Nawaz's speech, I think of Jim Carrey's & Russell Brand's
          comfort in the uncomfortable, I think of Gordon Ramsay's character.
          These are all examples of mastery of charisma in many different forms.
          I would have a great time talking to all of the above people lol.
        </div>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p className="prose-xl">
        <strong>Pillar #5: Creative Arts </strong>:
        <div>
          Someone that has achieved complete control over their skill. They are
          able to manipulate things in ways that not many people can, and make
          it look easy. I think of Hans Zimmer at composing, JUICE WRLD & Harry
          Mack at freestyling, Christopher Nolan at filmmaking, Chris Brown &
          Jason Derulo at dancing, Leonardo DiCaprio at acting, Adele at
          singing, Rick Riordan in writing.
        </div>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p className="prose-xl">
        No one in documented history has been able to master all 5 pillars. And
        I 100% will do it.
      </p>

        If you made it this far, thanks for reading. If anything that I wrote
        resonates with you, reach out to me.
